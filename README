  This archive contains the Makefile-based versions of software in
the STUBS project's Configurations releases. Please note that the
STUBS Toolchain and Utility Build Suite has a web page at:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Alongside this file should be various directories, which are
versioned by a combination of name and number (if obsolete/deprecated
or current) or date (if "development").

  Of these, the following directories create working chroot
environments based on the stated software combinations. All require a
reasonably feature-complete build environment as a start point
(unlike the published material in STUBS' Earlgrey/Franki
Configurations releases):

  earlgrey-0.6.x: Earlgrey environment, ie:
	- kernel 2.0.40
	- uClibc 0.9.20
	- busybox 0.60.5
	- gcc 2.7.2.3 (toolchain only, does not cross compile)
	- gcc 2.95.3 (compiles applications, also in environment)

  sencha-0.5/6.x: chroot environment featuring:
	- kernel 2.2.26
	- uClibc 0.9.20
	- busybox 0.60.5
	- gcc 2.7.2.3 (toolchain only, does not cross compile)
	- gcc 2.95.3 (compiles applications, also in environment)

  bancha-0.5/6.x: chroot environment featuring:
	- kernel 2.4.x
	- uClibc 0.9.28
	- busybox 1.01
	- possibly i386 only, has compiler (gcc 2.95.3)

  lching-0.5/6.x: chroot environment featuring
	- kernel 2.6.x
	- uClibc 0.9.28
	- busybox 1.4.0
	- gcc 4.1.1 (based on Gentoo patches)

  maof-0.5/6.x: as Lung Ching, for mips/mipsel

  geex-06xxxx: gcc 4.1.1 chroot inspired by GeeXboX 1.0

  The download URLs for all necessary software and patches should be
listed in the corresponding Makefiles. These are not automatically
retrieved (again, this funtionality IS in the STUBS scripts).

  All of the subdirectories have Makefiles that give (very) basic
help, and have targets for a host toolchain (`make htc`), a cross
compilation toolchain (`make xtc`), and the [cross compiled]
target "distribution" (`make xdc`) where this has been perfected. A
`make all` rule attempts to build all of these in turn.
