  Alongside this file should be various directories, which are
versioned by a combination of a) name and b) date (development
versions) or number (if current/deprecated/obsolete).

  Of the numbered versions, the following create working chroot
environments based on the stated software combinations. Prior to
version 0.8.x, all require a reasonably feature-complete host
environment as a start point (unlike the published material in STUBS'
Earlgrey/Franki Configurations releases, which is intended not to).

  earlgrey-0.8.x/0.9.x - Earlgrey environment, ie:
	* kernel 2.0.40
	* uClibc 0.9.20
	* busybox 0.60.5
	* gcc 2.7.2.3 (toolchain only, does not cross compile)
	* gcc 2.95.3 (compiles applications, also in environment)

  sencha-0.8.x/0.9.x - chroot environment featuring:
	* kernel 2.2.26
	* uClibc 0.9.26
	* busybox 1.1.0
	* gcc 2.95.3-2

  bancha-0.8.x/0.9.x - chroot environment featuring:
	* kernel 2.4.x
	* uClibc 0.9.26
	* busybox 1.1.0
	* gcc 2.95.3-2

  lching-0.8.x/0.9.x - chroot environment featuring:
	* kernel 2.6.x
	* uClibc 0.9.28
	* busybox 1.16.x
	* gcc 4.1.2 (based on Gentoo patches)

  maof-0.8.x/0.9.x - as Lung Ching, for mips/mipsel targets

  geex-10xxxx - alternative chroot environment inspired by GeeXboX 1.x

  The download URLs for all necessary software and patches should be
listed in the corresponding Makefiles. These are not automatically
retrieved (again, this funtionality IS in the STUBS scripts).

  All of the subdirectories have Makefiles that give (very) basic
help, and have targets for a host toolchain (`make htc`), a cross
compilation toolchain (`make xtc`), and the [cross compiled]
target "distribution" (`make xdc`). A `make all` rule attempts to
build all of these in turn.
